- **Centralized Management**: Managing both frontend and backend from a single repository in Elysia helps keep things streamlined and less fragmented.
- **Scalability**: TurboRepo ensures that as Elysia grows and adds more features, the build times will remain fast and efficient, improving team productivity.

## Backend Not Live (Railway Error)

Currently, the backend of Elysia is not live due to an issue with the **Railway** deployment service. We're actively working on resolving this issue and will provide updates as soon as the service is back online.

We appreciate your patience as we work through this technical challenge and strive to bring the full functionality of Elysia to you as soon as possible.
